This code is a demonstration program that shows how to use FreeRTOS on a Raspberry Pi Pico to control multiple LEDs using multitasking.

What the code does:

It controls several LEDs connected to different GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Each LED is managed by its own FreeRTOS task, so all LEDs can blink at the same time, independently.

The program demonstrates how to create, start, and manage multiple tasks using FreeRTOS.

It uses a counting semaphore to limit how many LED tasks can run at the same time, showing how shared resources can be synchronized safely.

One main task (mainTask) starts all other tasks and then continuously prints system statistics every few seconds.

Key features demonstrated:

Multitasking: Multiple LED blinking tasks run concurrently.

Task priorities: All tasks are created with the same priority to show cooperative scheduling.

Semaphores: A counting semaphore is used to control access to shared resources.

System monitoring: The program periodically displays:

Number of active tasks

Task priorities

Stack usage (high-water mark)

Heap (memory) usage statistics

Overall purpose:

The purpose of this code is educational. It is meant to demonstrate:

How FreeRTOS works on a microcontroller

How to structure an application using multiple tasks

How to synchronize tasks using semaphores

How to monitor system performance (CPU and memory usage)

In short, this program is a FreeRTOS example that shows how to blink multiple LEDs in parallel while managing tasks and system resources efficiently on a Raspberry Pi Pico.
