 Purpose of the Program

- Demonstrate how to create and run FreeRTOS tasks
- Show how multiple logging agents can run concurrently
- Monitor system health:
  - task states
  - priorities
  - stack usage
  - heap usage
- Provide a clean and extensible base for embedded RTOS projects


 Program Architecture

 Tasks Overview

 1. Main Task
The main task:
- Instantiates the agents
- Starts all other tasks
- Periodically prints system runtime statistics

 2. BlinkAgent
- Blinks an external LED connected to **GPIO 0**
- Runs as its own FreeRTOS task

3. LogAgentA / LogAgentB
- Independent logging agents
- Simulate a multi-source logging framework
- Demonstrate concurrent task execution



 Key Features

LED Blinking
- LED connected to `GPIO 0`
- Controlled by a dedicated FreeRTOS task

 FreeRTOS Runtime Statistics (`runTimeStats()`)

Every **5 seconds**, the program outputs:

- Total number of tasks
- For each task:
  - Task ID
  - Current priority
  - Base priority
  - Stack high water mark
  - Task name
- Heap statistics:
  - Available heap space
  - Number of free blocks
  - Successful allocations and frees

These statistics are useful for:
- Debugging
- Memory optimization
- Stack size validation


System Startup Flow

1. Initialize USB serial I/O
2. Wait 2 seconds for the serial connection to stabilize
3. Create the main FreeRTOS task
4. Start the FreeRTOS scheduler

- USB cable for serial console output


Software Dependencies

- **Raspberry Pi Pico SDK**
