Project Overview
----------------
This project demonstrates the use of **FreeRTOS**, an open-source real-time operating system, on the **Raspberry Pi Pico** microcontroller. The goal of the project is to control multiple LEDs using concurrent tasks. The program consists of three main tasks:

1. **BlinkAgent**: Blinks an LED at a regular interval.
2. **CounterAgent**: Displays a binary value on 4 LEDs, representing numbers from 0 to 15.
3. **MainTask**: Manages the interaction between the agents, generates random values, and prints system statistics to the terminal.

The project is a simple introduction to **multitasking** and **real-time operating systems** on embedded systems, using **FreeRTOS** for task management.

Components and Functionality
----------------------------
### FreeRTOS and Task Management
**FreeRTOS** is a real-time operating system designed for embedded systems. In this project, FreeRTOS handles task scheduling and ensures that multiple tasks run concurrently without interfering with each other. This is important for embedded systems where tasks must be completed within specific time constraints, and we don't want one task to block the execution of others.

There are **three tasks** in this project, each running independently:
- **MainTask**: The central task that controls the behavior of the program. It manages the interaction between BlinkAgent and CounterAgent, generates random values, and prints system statistics.
- **BlinkAgent**: A task that blinks an LED connected to GPIO pin 0. It runs in an infinite loop, toggling the LED on and off at regular intervals.
- **CounterAgent**: This task controls 4 LEDs connected to GPIO pins 2, 3, 4, and 5, and displays a binary pattern based on a random value generated by the MainTask. It uses the random number to display a 4-bit binary value.

### Task Priority and Scheduling
FreeRTOS allows tasks to run with different priorities. In this project, all tasks have the same priority (`tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1`). However, in more complex systems, tasks can be assigned different priorities, and FreeRTOS will handle the scheduling based on those priorities.

### GPIO Control
The project uses the **GPIO pins** of the Raspberry Pi Pico to control 5 LEDs:
- **GPIO 0**: The LED that blinks regularly (controlled by BlinkAgent).
- **GPIO 2, 3, 4, 5**: These LEDs display the binary value generated by the MainTask and processed by the CounterAgent.

### Random Number Generation
The MainTask generates a **random 4-bit value** (ranging from 0 to 15) using the `rand()` function. This value is then passed to CounterAgent, which turns the LEDs on or off to display the binary equivalent of the value.

The random value is also printed to the terminal, allowing users to see the current pattern being displayed on the LEDs.

### FreeRTOS Statistics
To help monitor system performance, the MainTask periodically prints **FreeRTOS runtime statistics**. These statistics include:
- **Task status**: Information about each task, such as the task name, priority, stack usage, and current state.
- **Heap memory usage**: Information about memory allocation, including the amount of available heap space and the number of successful memory allocations and deallocations.

This allows for performance monitoring and debugging in real-time.

System Design and Workflow
---------------------------
1. **Initialization**: The system first initializes the USB serial connection to provide output on the terminal. It also ensures the system has time to settle before starting the main tasks.
   
2. **Task Creation**: The `mainTask` is created, which, in turn, creates and starts the BlinkAgent and CounterAgent tasks.
   
3. **Task Execution**: Each task enters its infinite loop, where:
   - **BlinkAgent** blinks the LED at regular intervals.
   - **CounterAgent** updates the LED pattern based on the random value generated by the MainTask.
   
4. **FreeRTOS Scheduler**: FreeRTOS handles task scheduling and manages task switching, ensuring that each task gets enough CPU time.

5. **System Monitoring**: Every 3 seconds, the MainTask prints FreeRTOS statistics and generates a new random value to send to the CounterAgent.

Code Structure and Key Files
----------------------------
1. **main.cpp**: The main entry point of the program, which initializes FreeRTOS, creates tasks, and starts the scheduler.
   
2. **BlinkAgent.h / BlinkAgent.cpp**: Contains the definition and implementation of the BlinkAgent task, which controls the blinking LED on GPIO 0.
   
3. **CounterAgent.h / CounterAgent.cpp**: Defines and implements the CounterAgent task, which controls the 4 LEDs to display a binary value.
   
4. **runTimeStats()**: A function in the main task that prints runtime statistics about FreeRTOS tasks, including task priorities, stack usage, and heap memory.

Hardware Connections
--------------------
The hardware setup for this project is as follows:
- **GPIO 0**: Connected to the blinking LED (controlled by BlinkAgent).
- **GPIO 2, 3, 4, 5**: Connected to the 4 LEDs, which represent a 4-bit binary number (controlled by CounterAgent).

Each LED is connected to the GPIO pin through a 330-ohm resistor, and all LEDs are connected to ground.

Compilation and Flashing
------------------------
1. **Install Pico SDK**: Ensure that the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK is installed and properly set up.
2. **Create Build Directory**:  
   ```bash
   mkdir build  
   cd build
