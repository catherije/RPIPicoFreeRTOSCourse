1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of FreeRTOS tasks on a Raspberry Pi Pico to control LEDs and display a random binary value.

A main task launches two FreeRTOS agents:

BlinkAgent: blinks a status LED

CounterAgent: displays a random binary number using LEDs

For this exercise, additional LEDs were added to extend the binary output and improve visualization.

2. Features

FreeRTOS multitasking

Random binary number generation

LED binary display

Runtime task statistics

Heap memory monitoring

USB serial debug output

3. Hardware Configuration
Components Used

Raspberry Pi Pico

8 LEDs

8 resistors (220Ω – 330Ω recommended)

Breadboard and jumper wires

GPIO to LED Mapping
LED	GPIO
Status LED	GPIO 0
LED1	GPIO 1
LED2	GPIO 2
LED3	GPIO 3
LED4	GPIO 4
LED5	GPIO 5
LED6	GPIO 6
LED7	GPIO 7

 Note:
I added extra LEDs for this exercise to display a wider binary value.

4. Software Architecture
Tasks Used
Main Task (mainTask)

Starts BlinkAgent and CounterAgent

Calls runtime statistics function

Generates a random number

Displays the value using LEDs

Runs every 3 seconds

BlinkAgent

Blinks a status LED on GPIO 0

CounterAgent

Displays a binary number using multiple LEDs

5. Runtime Statistics

The function runTimeStats() displays:

Number of active tasks

Current and base task priorities

Stack high water mark

Heap usage statistics

This helps detect:

Stack overflow risks

Memory leaks

Task behavior issues

8. SOP – Standard Operating Procedure

Connect LEDs to the Pico GPIO pins with resistors

Build the project using Pico SDK

Flash the firmware to the Pico

Connect USB and open a serial monitor (115200 baud)

Observe:

Status LED blinking

Binary values displayed on LEDs

Runtime statistics printed every 3 seconds

9. Q&A

Q: Why FreeRTOS?
A: FreeRTOS enables real-time multitasking and better system organization.

Q: Why add more LEDs?
A: To improve binary visualization and extend the exercise functionality.

Q: What is the Stack High Water Mark?
A: It shows the minimum unused stack space, helping prevent stack overflow.

Q: Why mask random value with 0x0F?
A: To limit the random number to 4 bits for controlled LED output.

10. Comments & Notes

Always use resistors with LEDs

Heap statistics help debug memory issues

Suitable for learning FreeRTOS on microcontrollers

Code runs on core 0 only

11. Final Comment

This project demonstrates practical FreeRTOS usage, GPIO control, and system monitoring on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
The addition of extra LEDs enhances learning and visualization of binary data.
