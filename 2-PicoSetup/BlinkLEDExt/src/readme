 Purpose of the Program

- Demonstrate how to use **FreeRTOS on Raspberry Pi Pico**
- Show how to blink an LED using a **FreeRTOS task**
- Serve as a starting point for RTOS-based embedded applications



 Program Overview
Main Task (`mainTask`)

The main task:
- Initializes GPIO pad **0** as an output
- Toggles the LED ON and OFF
- Uses a delay of **500 ms** between toggles
- Runs indefinitely under FreeRTOS control

The LED blinking is handled entirely inside a FreeRTOS task.

 Key Definitions

- **LED GPIO Pad:** `GPIO 0`
- **Blink Delay:** `500 ms`
- **Task Priority:** `Idle priority + 1`
- **Stack Size:** `configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE`

 How It Works

1. USB serial output is initialized
2. The system waits 2 seconds to allow the serial connection to stabilize
3. A FreeRTOS task (`mainTask`) is created
4. The FreeRTOS scheduler is started
5. The LED blinks continuously while the scheduler is running

Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- External LED connected to:
  - GPIO 0
  - Appropriate current-limiting resistor
- USB cable for power and serial output

 Software Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico SDK
- FreeRTOS configured for Pico
- Standard C library (`stdio`)

 Typical Use Cases

This example is useful for:
- Learning how to use FreeRTOS tasks
- Understanding GPIO control under an RTOS
- Creating a baseline project for more complex multitasking applications
- Teaching RTOS fundamentals in embedded systems courses

 Notes

- `vTaskDelay()` is used instead of `sleep_ms()` to allow proper task scheduling
- The program runs entirely on **core 0**
- Only one task is used, making the behavior easy to understand and debug
